### Brief guide to my projects

- **React Subscription** [[demo]](https://aethelz.github.io/react-subscription/) [[code]](https://github.com/aethelz/react-subscription)<br />
This is my solution to a take-home assignment done in 4 days in spare time. It features a finished React + TypeScript app with basic Redux setup and Bulma styling.
- **React CRUD dashboard** [[demo]](https://aethelz.github.io/react-crud-dashboard/) [[code]](https://github.com/aethelz/react-crud-dashboard)<br />
This is my solution to a take-home CodeSubmit CRUD assignment with a 6 hour time limit. It features a finished app with Cypress tests.
- **React - Wookie Movies** [[demo]](https://aethelz.github.io/react-wookie-movies/#/) [[code]](https://github.com/aethelz/react-wookie-movies)<br />
This is my solution to a demo take-home assignment with heavy router usage done over the course of a week in spare time.
- **squooshNode** [[code]](https://github.com/aethelz/squooshNode) *Image CDN based on Squoosh and Node.js*<br />
A second attempt to use wasm codecs from Squoosh for image processing on the back-end. This actually turned out pretty well, but I didn't have time to finish it. I ended up using some fancy monads from [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts), they seemed to fit pipeline-based flow very well here.
- **ICDeno** [[code]](https://github.com/aethelz/ICDeno) *Image CDN based on Squoosh and Deno*<br />
I wanted to solve a very specific work problem I had with generating color-quantized pngs and webp images from remote png links, basically what [imgpoxy](https://imgproxy.net/) does in a paid version, but with Deno and wasm codecs from [Squoosh](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh). I beat Google to this idea by a  month, but their [solution](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/pull/875) was very hard to port for generic use. Deno turned out to be unsuitable for this at the time due to numerous upstream issues, to I ended up rewriting it to Node. 
- **GarminGraphs** [[link]](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/garmin-graphs/) [[code]](https://github.com/aethelz/garmin-graphs) *Garmin Connect Web Firefox extension with colored Zone Graphs*<br />
This browser extension adds basic data visualization functionality that Garmin wouldn't implement for a decade, turned out to be somewhat popular, took quite a bit of work too, so one of the things I'm really proud of :)
- **REFirefoxExtension** [[link]](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/re-in-stryd/) [[code]](https://github.com/aethelz/REFirefoxExtension) *Stryd Running Efficiency Firefox extension*<br />
My first foray into browser extensions, ported and later completly rewritten with permission from original [author](https://github.com/divad1978)
- **extraVerDa** [[code]](https://github.com/aethelz/extraVerDa) *Svelte \ Node.js \ SQLite data parser*<br />
My first fully-featured full-stack app, foolishly spent my vacation on it :)
- **tardis** [[demo]](https://aethelz.gitlab.io/tardis/) [[code]](https://github.com/aethelz/tardis) *Simple calculator to help with dry fire*<br />
Simple single file Vue.js SPA
- **bezier** [[demo]](https://aethelz.gitlab.io/bezier/) [[code]](https://github.com/aethelz/bezier) *A simple pure JS+SVG bezier curve drawing app*<br />
Take-home assignment solution that landed me my first software developer job ðŸš€
- **ballistgraph** [[demo]](https://aethelz.gitlab.io/366/) [[code]](https://github.com/aethelz/ballistgraph) *A simple VanillaJS cartridge-comparing webapp*<br />
My first project in Vanilla JavaScript ðŸ™ˆ
